# Release preparation

2026-09-06: Prepared a portable setup recipe from accepted framework `00a8ae0051e85c7d07ceb6c0a7bea9a315f8c476`.
The release snapshot keeps functional code and title seed bytes, adds the bounded setup backport, and excludes private input/history.
Consulted the local release process, PSX-PUB-016, the accepted title handoff, and [Git orphan-branch documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout).
The shared archive gate now accepts only exact hashes for two intentional SDK path-example files; changed and relocated fixtures still fail.
Native CI and Windows package acceptance are pending.

2026-09-07: Native canary gates required the existing PSX-BUILD-024 C-linkage correction and the exact public recomp-ui be8ac1d portable tool text fix. The package now carries all four complete public dependency identities (PSX-PUB-027). No game runtime behavior or recipe settings changed in this update. Native build and package checks remain required.
